Secondly, you will see in the submission requirements that I only need some methods to be implemented for me to assess quantitatively your work. I consider that if all of these methods are implemented you followed the instructions. The report will then give you a chance to justify your approach. This should give you a lot of freedom. In particular at step 2 I propose to use motion planning to compute a reference path for the robot. If you choose a different approach it does not matter to me as long as we discussed it before and that it is not hard-coded somehow. "

If you choose your first three control points to be strictly equal for instance, the initial velocity and acceleration of your trajectory will be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Thirdly, a Bezier curve lies completely in the convex hull of its control points. What this means for optimisation is that if you define linear inequality constraints on the control points of the curve, you have the guarantee that that every point on the curve satisfies these constraints. This will allow you to easily specify constraints on the derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose to go that way, you can decide that your optimisation variables are the control points of your Bezier curve; you can then linearly define the value of the trajectory at each time step as a linear combination of these control points and write your cost function as a function of these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, the idea is not to explicitely address the collision constraints. You will assume that if you track your path well enough you will avoid collisions. This is commonly done in robotics.\n",

While the API is different the concepts described are the same. **Note that I m not necessarily suggesting to use ndcurves, simply to look at the tutorials to understand the ideas and replicate this.** Still, if you want to you can decide to directly use ndcurves. It has an api a bit more complex that the simple Bezier class I provided as it is more powerful, so it is for you to decide, there is no good or bad solution here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time parametrisation:\n",
    "If you follow the guidelines from the tutorial, the optimisation will give you a smooth trajectory, but by default it will have a duration of 1. You can easily add velocity constraints and include time as a variable in your problem . You could also add acceleration constraints and ignore velocities by using $t^2$ as a variable instead of $t$. We can discuss this on Piazza. You can't consider both velocity and acceleration constraints otherwise your problem will become non-linear (do you see why ?)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling grasping constraints:\n",
    "If you are planning a trajectory just for the effectors then it is really easy to handle these constraints: you can just plan for the cube and then deduce the effector placements at each step.\n",
    "It might be harder to do it for a configuration space trajectory, but it is not necessarily required:\n",
    "I believe that if the tracked trajectory is good enough you should not need to handle the grasping constraints as accurately as this will be fixed by the control law. \n",
    "If you want to handle these constraints, there are a variety of post processes that you can choose to implement this, but though the problem becomes non-linear again... I suggest to avoid this unless it really proves useful (again I think not, or at least it was not necessary for me).\n",

    "### 3. level 2: Handling collision constraints\n",
    "First of all, don't go there in the first instance. Wait until you are done with the complete lab to decide whether you are interested in doing this. You can try to handle collisions in a variety of ways that we can discuss on Piazza. The straightforward approach is to write a non linear program that will handle this as we have done before. Because you have a reference motion that is collision free, you may get away with a NLP to refine the trajectory obtained when solving level 1 so as to avoid collisions."

    "Ok now, you have everything that you need to grasp that box and move it to its target.\n",

    "Again, we are going to use pybullet to control our robot. Pybullet is a dynamics simulator which is used by roboticists to test the behaviours of their controllers before deploying them on their robots. It was originally developed for video games, and depending on your application it is not always considered as very accurate. However for manipulators it works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interaction with Pybullet \n",
    "\n",
    "The philosophy I propose to interact with Pybullet is implemented in the [control.py main function](https://github.com/ediaro23/lab/blob/9a2b0c74b4ba1702da8f86fc1fa845e513ab4cfd/control.py#L61):\n",

    "    - get the current state of the robot in the simulator (method getpybulletstate)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - work out all the computations in pinocchio\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - send a torque command to the simulator to update the state of the robot (method step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pybullet is configured here to work as a step-by-step simulation, as opposed to real time. Everytime you call the step method, the simulation integrates DT seconds of time, with DT defined in config.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "In tools.py, I have added a method [rununtil](https://github.com/ediaro23/lab/blob/9a2b0c74b4ba1702da8f86fc1fa845e513ab4cfd/tools.py#L102C5-L102C10) that you can use to update the simulation at a frequency that corresponds to a realtime mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run control.py, assuming the initial state is the robot.q0 configuration, the first thing you will see is a very chaotic behaviour from the robot: indeed, as it starts in collision, the simulator will apply really high forces to compense the penetration violation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you initialise correctly the inital state, in the absence of torque command the robot arms will fall under the effect of gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main methods needed to work with pybullet are defined in the Simulation class defined in [setup_pybullet.py](https://github.com/ediaro23/lab/blob/9a2b0c74b4ba1702da8f86fc1fa845e513ab4cfd/setup_pybullet.py). A few others are defined in the base class Simulation_base but I don't expect you will need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The helper method to load the robot in both pinocchio and pybullet environments is setupwithpybullet. If you still want to work with meshcast in parallel (for some strange reason that I can't explain I found it convenient) you can instead call setupwithpybulletandmeshcat.\n",

    "### Optional task 0: Control without the cube\n",
    "To test your controller, it might be a good idea to first control the motion of the effectors without grasping the cube. Generate a simple trajectory that brings the effectors above the starting position and implement the control law to achieve the motion. Regarding the gains, you definitely have the options to tune them individually for each joint (and you would have do this on the actual robot). When I programmed the lab I just used Kp = 300 and $Kd = 2 \\sqrt(Kd)$ for all joints and it worked fine. Once you ll have verified that you obtain a satisfying behaviour, you'll be ready to move to the actual task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The actual task\n",
    "Proceed as you wish to have the robot grasp the cube and then bring it to the target location. It does not matter to me how this is achieved in terms of the motion I see, as long as some grasping (ie the robot is holding the cube above the table for some relevant period of time) happens. You can push the cube to align it in the end if you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the behaviour, you will need to apply a control law. Everything here is set for you to control the robot in torque, which I do believe is the easy way to go. If you want to try controling this using position or velocity control, this is also an option (actually the real Nextage robot is only position controlled).\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended way, in my opinion, is to apply inverse dynamics control to track the trajectory while applying a linear force to the cube with both hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "This force control law should naturally cope with the alignment errors and have the effect of attracting the effectors to the cube \n",
